## 🚀 About Me

Hi, I’m **Rian** or **Ferian**, a DevSecOps Engineer passionate about making systems **automated**, **secure**, and **scalable** — without sacrificing speed or reliability.

I bridge the gap between development, operations, and security by building pipelines and platforms that **just work** — resilient, observable, and ready to scale. Whether it's deploying infrastructure as code, containerizing workloads, or designing secure CI/CD pipelines, I focus on **solutions that scale** and **security that sticks**.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Here’s what I build with every day:

### 🧰 DevOps & Automation
- **CI/CD**: Azure DevOps, GitLab CI, Jenkins
- **IaC**: Terraform, Ansible
- **Monitoring & Observability**: Grafana, Prometheus, Loki, Datadog, Dynatrace

### ☁️ Cloud & Container Platforms
- **Cloud**: Azure, AWS, GCP, OpenStack
- **Kubernetes**: AKS, k3s, self-hosted clusters
- **Containers**: Docker, Podman, CRI
- **Container Registry**: Harbor, ACR, ECR

### 🧪 Orchestration & Automation Tools
- **Helm**: Chart templating & deployment
- **n8n**, **Node-RED**: No-code/low-code automation
- **Scripting**: PowerShell, Bash, Python

## ✨ Highlights

- ⏱️ **Reduced deployment time by 83%** with fully automated provisioning  
- 🔐 **Cut production incidents by 60%** through centralized observability  
- 🛡️ Designed secure Kubernetes clusters with **Harbor**, **Helm**, and **K3s/AKS**  
- 🧠 Developed custom automations using **n8n** and **Node-RED**  
- 🏆 Winner: **ISO 27001:2022 Security Awareness Survey**  
- 🌍 Architected cost-efficient multi-cloud environments (Azure & AWS)

## 📚 What I Believe

- Security **should be invisible** — built into the system, not bolted on  
- If you **repeat it twice**, automate it  
- Logs are not noise — they’re insight waiting to be used  
- Open source + clear documentation = faster teams and better systems
